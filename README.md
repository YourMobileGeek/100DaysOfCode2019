# 100DaysOfCode2
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
  > Completed another module of the MLCC course. This module was about introduction to neural networks. NN are more sophisticated versions of *feature crosses*. We can use them because they can easily scale up to fit a nonlinear model. Used the tensorflow [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to adapt to a noisy spiral with NN as a task.

* Day 2
  > Completed the MLCC course today. Glad that i did something in ML. Other than that, laptop broke down. So i may not post for a couple days or more.

* Day 3
  > Could only manage to watch a video. [Firestore video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o7d5Zeic63s&t=0s&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ&index=5) [Firebase IO](https://youtu.be/VTkM5BbnslU)

* Day 4
  > Managed to watch a [video interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_QdJ-spWgg). Dont know how long till normal routine resumes.
