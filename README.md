# 100DaysOfCode2
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
  > Completed another module of the MLCC course. This module was about introduction to neural networks. NN are more sophisticated versions of *feature crosses*. We can use them because they can easily scale up to fit a nonlinear model. Used the tensorflow [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to adapt to a noisy spiral with NN as a task.

* Day 2
  > Completed the MLCC course today. Glad that i did something in ML. Other than that, laptop broke down. So i may not post for a couple days or more.

* Day 3
  > Could only manage to watch a video. [Firestore video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o7d5Zeic63s&t=0s&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ&index=5) [Firebase IO](https://youtu.be/VTkM5BbnslU)

* Day 4
  > Managed to watch a [video interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_QdJ-spWgg). Dont know how long till normal routine resumes.

* Day 5
  > [polyfills](https://youtu.be/RoVy9EoIloQ)

* Day 6
  > Listened to a podcast on debugging by Codepen Radio.

* Day 7
  > Listened to a podcast from Google's Designer vs Developer.

* Day 8
  > Completed a module of the Pluralsight course. It was about services in angular. Laptop is ok now, cost me a lot though.

* Day 8
  > Completed 2 more modules of the Pluralsight course. The modules covered Navigation and routing between views (single page app issues).

* Day 9
  > Completed 2 more modules and hence the course. The repo is complete as well. Last part was about fine tuning the routing and finishing up. There was a module about modules of Angular. Also, i tried making the tensorflow [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) in a python notebook. It may not be pushed here (I'll think about it). Other than that, i am trying to implement an algo in a pen. Currently i am searching for the bug in it (have been searching for a while). Maybe i'll push it here tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Completed the algo. pushed [here](https://github.com/kaydee/Some-Pens) too. Working link will be posted soon. UPDATE: working [link](https://codepen.io/KayD33/full/vzwVBj/)
  
* Day 11
  > Almost completed the algorithm thing. Just minor UI stuff left. Looking pretty good too.
