# 100DaysOfCode2
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
  > Completed another module of the MLCC course. This module was about introduction to neural networks. NN are more sophisticated versions of *feature crosses*. We can use them because they can easily scale up to fit a nonlinear model. Used the tensorflow [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to adapt to a noisy spiral with NN as a task.

* Day 2
  > Completed the MLCC course today. Glad that i did something in ML. Other than that, laptop broke down. So i may not post for a couple days or more.
