# 100DaysOfCode2
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
  > Completed another module of the MLCC course. This module was about introduction to neural networks. NN are more sophisticated versions of *feature crosses*. We can use them because they can easily scale up to fit a nonlinear model. Used the tensorflow [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to adapt to a noisy spiral with NN as a task.

* Day 2
  > Completed the MLCC course today. Glad that i did something in ML. Other than that, laptop broke down. So i may not post for a couple days or more.

* Day 3
  > Could only manage to watch a video. [Firestore video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o7d5Zeic63s&t=0s&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ&index=5) [Firebase IO](https://youtu.be/VTkM5BbnslU)

* Day 4
  > Managed to watch a [video interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_QdJ-spWgg). Dont know how long till normal routine resumes.

* Day 5
  > [polyfills](https://youtu.be/RoVy9EoIloQ)

* Day 6
  > Listened to a podcast on debugging by Codepen Radio.

* Day 7
  > Listened to a podcast from Google's Designer vs Developer.

* Day 8
  > Completed a module of the Pluralsight course. It was about services in angular. Laptop is ok now, cost me a lot though.

* Day 8
  > Completed 2 more modules of the Pluralsight course. The modules covered Navigation and routing between views (single page app issues).

* Day 9
  > Completed 2 more modules and hence the course. The repo is complete as well. Last part was about fine tuning the routing and finishing up. There was a module about modules of Angular. Also, i tried making the tensorflow [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) in a python notebook. It may not be pushed here (I'll think about it). Other than that, i am trying to implement an algo in a pen. Currently i am searching for the bug in it (have been searching for a while). Maybe i'll push it here tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Completed the algo. pushed [here](https://github.com/kaydee/Some-Pens) too. Working link will be posted soon. UPDATE: working [link](https://codepen.io/KayD33/full/vzwVBj/)
  
* Day 11
  > Almost completed the algorithm thing. Just minor UI stuff left. Looking pretty good too.

* Day 12
  > The algorithm is done. Now maybe i will work on a more advanced version of it next week. Also, spent the rest of the day surfing for suitable repos. *Preparing for Hacktoberfest*. So far, i have 3. 2 more to go.

* Day 13
  > Continued the search for the repos. Found a few. Will try to find the changes needed on the weekend. I am getting that Hacktober swag, at any cost.

* Day 14
  > Worked on a repo. Made the required changes. Now i'll make a PR after the contest opens. Hope it works. So 1 down: 4 to go.

* Day 15
  > Continued the Repo search. I am aiming for more than 5 now.

* Day 16
  > Didn't do much other than thinking about the PRs that i will make. I only have the repos, not the changes. Other than that, getting ready for the fest.

* Day 17
  > Completed the Hacktoberfest challenge today in the morning. Rest of the day i tried a little bit of basic Hackerrank. Trying to get back to online code. Lets see how long i follow this idea.

* Day 18
  > Did some hackerrank today. Accompanying that were a few short videos on beginner OOPS concepts i thought i need to watch again, just for fun. Wanted to start with alexa, but that will take some time so postponing it.

* Day 19
  > Did some more Hackerrank today. Difficult finding time these days, don't know why.

* Day 20
  > Did the 30 days of Code thing on Hackerrank. The thing i took from it is that if you are doing it too, do watch the tutorial videos as well. They are very helpful no matter how much you already know. Also watched couple of videos on algos on youtube. Update ( added links for the video(s) ): [Tricky JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsNxdukPc2U) , [Python Tutorial: if __name__ == '__main__'
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sugvnHA7ElY)

* Day 21
  > Tried solving a couple questions. Had to leave them because of shortage of time. Will try tomorrow.
