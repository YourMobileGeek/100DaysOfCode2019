# 100 Days Of Code (2019) 
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
> Completed a 20 minute tutorial which focused on giving a first look at Gatsby, a static site generator for React. Getting a bit more familiarity with the workflow/ functionaility this is something I would like to dig a bit more deeper into. [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSemYFzHAtU)

> I started a workshop on treehouse called "Deploying a React App", I ran into a small error when running the build react script due to my eslint version being a newly realeased but still want to find a solution on installing the correct version of eslint so that the project can be built.
