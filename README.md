# 100DaysOfCode2
A documentation of my 100 days of code challenge

* Day 1
  > Completed another module of the MLCC course. This module was about introduction to neural networks. NN are more sophisticated versions of *feature crosses*. We can use them because they can easily scale up to fit a nonlinear model. Used the tensorflow [playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/) to adapt to a noisy spiral with NN as a task.

* Day 2
  > Completed the MLCC course today. Glad that i did something in ML. Other than that, laptop broke down. So i may not post for a couple days or more.

* Day 3
  > Could only manage to watch a video. [Firestore video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=o7d5Zeic63s&t=0s&list=PLl-K7zZEsYLluG5MCVEzXAQ7ACZBCuZgZ&index=5) [Firebase IO](https://youtu.be/VTkM5BbnslU)

* Day 4
  > Managed to watch a [video interview](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_QdJ-spWgg). Dont know how long till normal routine resumes.

* Day 5
  > [polyfills](https://youtu.be/RoVy9EoIloQ)

* Day 6
  > Listened to a podcast on debugging by Codepen Radio.

* Day 7
  > Listened to a podcast from Google's Designer vs Developer.

* Day 8
  > Completed a module of the Pluralsight course. It was about services in angular. Laptop is ok now, cost me a lot though.

* Day 8
  > Completed 2 more modules of the Pluralsight course. The modules covered Navigation and routing between views (single page app issues).

* Day 9
  > Completed 2 more modules and hence the course. The repo is complete as well. Last part was about fine tuning the routing and finishing up. There was a module about modules of Angular. Also, i tried making the tensorflow [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) in a python notebook. It may not be pushed here (I'll think about it). Other than that, i am trying to implement an algo in a pen. Currently i am searching for the bug in it (have been searching for a while). Maybe i'll push it here tomorrow.

* Day 10
  > Completed the algo. pushed [here](https://github.com/kaydee/Some-Pens) too. Working link will be posted soon. UPDATE: working [link](https://codepen.io/KayD33/full/vzwVBj/)
  
* Day 11
  > Almost completed the algorithm thing. Just minor UI stuff left. Looking pretty good too.

* Day 12
  > The algorithm is done. Now maybe i will work on a more advanced version of it next week. Also, spent the rest of the day surfing for suitable repos. *Preparing for Hacktoberfest*. So far, i have 3. 2 more to go.

* Day 13
  > Continued the search for the repos. Found a few. Will try to find the changes needed on the weekend. I am getting that Hacktober swag, at any cost.

* Day 14
  > Worked on a repo. Made the required changes. Now i'll make a PR after the contest opens. Hope it works. So 1 down: 4 to go.

* Day 15
  > Continued the Repo search. I am aiming for more than 5 now.

* Day 16
  > Didn't do much other than thinking about the PRs that i will make. I only have the repos, not the changes. Other than that, getting ready for the fest.

* Day 17
  > Completed the Hacktoberfest challenge today in the morning. Rest of the day i tried a little bit of basic Hackerrank. Trying to get back to online code. Lets see how long i follow this idea.

* Day 18
  > Did some hackerrank today. Accompanying that were a few short videos on beginner OOPS concepts i thought i need to watch again, just for fun. Wanted to start with alexa, but that will take some time so postponing it.

* Day 19
  > Did some more Hackerrank today. Difficult finding time these days, don't know why.

* Day 20
  > Did the 30 days of Code thing on Hackerrank. The thing i took from it is that if you are doing it too, do watch the tutorial videos as well. They are very helpful no matter how much you already know. Also watched couple of videos on algos on youtube. Update ( added links for the video(s) ): [Tricky JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsNxdukPc2U) , [Python Tutorial: if __name__ == '__main__'
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sugvnHA7ElY)

* Day 21
  > Tried solving a couple questions. Had to leave them because of shortage of time. Will try tomorrow.

* Day 22
  > Little tired today. Solved only one of the hackerrank questions. It was a simple one.

* Day 23
  > Successfully completed a medium level question on hackerrank. Its not a lot but took me more than half of the day. Other than that, i have started learning Alexa skill development. Hopfully i have something to show for tomorrow.

* Day 24
  > Spent another day not implementing anything. This time the learning was for Alexa. I did make a few test skills, but nothing good enough to mention. I'll surely make something tomorrow.

* Day 25
  > Day was spent in searching for various ideas. Sadly, i'm nowhere close to having a good idea. On the bright side, few steps away from deploying my first Alexa skill.

* Day 26
  > Started working on an Alexa skill. I think the idea is good, just don't know if i'll be successful in implementing it. So far, nowhere close.

* Day 27
  > Still working on the skill. Came across a diffculty, It involves figuring out how to save data that the user might need. Its a big one.  Dont know if i'll overcome it or drop the skill.
  
* Day 28
  > Spent the day on codechef. No skill developing today (yesterday). Maybe i'll do it today, if i get the time.

* Day 29
  > Tried solving chef's problems. Failed miserably. Then continued working on the skill. I am currently in a ditch there too. For some reason, the database stuff is interfering with the node stuff. I don't really appreciate it but i'll try to fix it tomorrow.

* Day 30
  > Completed the skill. Ran into quite a fiasco when i came to know that it doesnt support English-IN (which is like my main target audience). I thought adding a language would be easy, just add a new language. But  what i didn't know was that every language needs a new model and a new lambda corresponding to the new language location. Took me the day to do that. Not going to do that for my previous skill though. Other than that i think the next couple days will be spent thinking of a new idea for a skill.

* Day 31
  > Did another codechef problem and attempted another one. Also, amongst the thoughts, i am still nowhere close to my next skill. I have a week, not more than that to develop and deploy my skill.

* Day 32
  > Started working on a new skill. It's a simple quiz skill, bit of a letdown after the message conveying skill, but its ok. Hope i get that echo i'm working for.

* Day 33
  > Banging my head because of one error, that is not even supposed to happen. Spent the whole day on it and i'm still clueless. Its a kind of error that is preventing my publishing of the skill. I hope i find it before going crazy, because without help, i might.*UPDATE*: after 12 hours of try, that bug is fixed. Now i have another one, the data i need in the DB is being written somewhere not in my DB. Need to figure out where and why.

* Day 34
  > 11 hrs today. I'm tired. One of skill i submitted before got rejected and that took a long time. Also, the persisting error that i wrote about earlier also took a long time, but eventually was fixed. The alexa developer community is still budding and not that big. Could just be my opinion because of the experiences with the JS community. Still, people are helpful. Also, if you are using [this](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia) repo as template, you should know that this is buggy and you need to fix it. A very helpful [pull request](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-trivia/pull/41/files) (if it is not already merged at the time of your reading). Maybe i will push a repo helping alexa starters (if i remember to do so).

* Day 35
  > Light stuff today. Only a few videos on youtube. Was saving my energy for [Snackdown 2019](https://www.codechef.com/snackdown), which btw went horrible. Only solved 2 questions out of 5. Not selecting for the next round, thats for sure. Not happy today.

* Day 36
  > Watched videos today. Wide range, from interviews to tutorials of different techs, even theory videos (like concepts in CS). Came accross a video, (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs4uzHm_8-o)) about snappy scroll feature in CSS. I have to say i am not happy about it. Mainly because i have seen good websites ruin themselves by implementing it. Its a very selective feature that can either boost your storytelling or bust up your UX. Today was basically thinking about what to do next. I do have a lot of things to do. Can't do them all at once. Maybe i'll start something tomorrow.

* Day 37
  > Two out of six of my PRs for hacktoberfest have been closed without merging. They weren't anything good, but i did think they would be merged. Anyways one of the alexa skill got rejected again saying that it wasn't showing the cards on the *echo spot*. Apparently, it has a screen and it helps if appropriate cards are shown with the audio. Found the commands from the docs (*failed*), then came back to Stack Overflow. So submitted it and being a weekend, i have to wait for tuesday for another rejection. Other than that, a video and a podcast was all i could do today. (Sunday)

* Day 38
  > The skill got approved finally. It is on the amazon india store named *Indian Culture Quiz*. Its a simple quiz game but in hindi. Also, i was thinking of making something in react but i only did hackerrank today. React has to wait for a while.

* Day 39
  > Decided to start the React thing today. But ```create-react-app``` decided to delete itself for some reason. Other than that, now that its version two came out, it has some specific requirements that i didn't match. Then upgrading node is a pain because i have to remember how i installed it in first place. Got tired and uninstalled and reinstalled node. Now i created the base app and pushing that here (in a bit). Will start real work from tomorrow. I did try (and complete) one hackerrank problem, easy level.

* Day 40
  > Watched a talk on web assembly today ([Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4)). Also, working on the react thing. Not in a good mood so not writing much. The video was good.

* Day 41
  > A couple of Easy level Hackerrank problems was all i could manage to do today. In need of serious working for a while now.

* Day 42
  > Third alexa skill was rejected today. Its almost October end and i haven't completed my challenge. Spent the whole day trying to find a fix for the problem. I'll explain the problem once it gets accepted in time.

* Day 43
  > Submitted the skill again after small changes. Not really sure if it even works. Its weekend again and the month is almost over, so maybe i may not be able to complete the challenge. Other than that, i attempted the first set of problems in the *October Easy '18* on Hackerearth. Solved one out of the three. Also, worked on the react thing too. Holiday today, so managed to do more than everyday.

* Day 44
  > Attended Devfest '18 today, so i guess i won't be failing the challenge as of today. But to make sure of it, i did solve one problem of hackerrank. Fest was good, my first ever. Attended some good talks by cool speakers. If you get a chance, listen to [the dagger](https://github.com/the-dagger) at least once. Other than that, i needed some speakers i needed to talk to today, but social issues. Tired today.

* Day 45
  > My skill didn't get a review and its almost the end of the month. So, i decided and made another one of the simple skills. Just to be on the safe side. I need those perks. Other than that i was searching for an ML project. I do have some interesting choices. Will share once i finalise.

* Day 46
  > Attended an event today by Google. It was a good event, just not really for me. Spent the whole day there.

* Day 47
  > Worked on the react thing. Only couple day work left on that. Hope i finish before weekend. I want to start something new.

* Day 48
  > Going really slow on the React thing. I'll try to take out time tomorrow.

* Day 49
  > I was thinking about making a fractal or two since morning. So i made a *Mandelbrot Set* [here](https://github.com/KayDee/Some-Pens/tree/master/Mandlebrot%20Set). Took a little while to find a page where they explained coloring the set with a programmer's point of view. Other than that i am struggling with the React project. It was a page, but considering the obstacles, i've got to call it a project. The tutorial i'm learning from is either outdated or filled with bugs. Apart from the basic stuff, nothing is seem to be working. I'm myself surprised when i fix one of the bugs, like how do i know to do that stuff. I hope i can fix it all the way. It will take more time than i thought. Other than that, my application for *Github Campus Experts* has been accepted.

* Day 50
  > I have now the first working page of React auth with Firebase. The tutotial page was filled with bugs (Still very informative). Check it out [here](https://www.robinwieruch.de/complete-firebase-authentication-react-tutorial/). Also, working on the Julia set now. It was pretty easy. Will try to animate it tomorrow, if JS allows me. I was going to do my first GHCE exercise, but i wasn't in a good mood today, so postponed that for tomorrow.

* Day 51
  > Pushed the Julia set today. Didn't animate it, i tried, but it is very laggy even on a 150 pixel surface. I guess my code isn't optimised. It will work in *Processing*. But i won't do it. Other than that, watched a video on *this* in JS. Now, for the good news, my skill that was stuck for a long time was finally accepted today. Three skills published now. Also, i got an email saying that i passed the nomination round for [*Developer Students Club*](https://medium.com/@walkytalkyshubham/developer-student-club-by-subham-kumar-8f674a0f0aa4) of my college. Now have to work on the selection round. Fingers crossed.

* Day 52
  > The first exercise of GHCE took a lot of time. Couldn't do anything else. I was travelling today, came back around noon.

* Day Diwali
  > Happy Diwali !! I kinda took the day off today. I don't know if i lost the challenge officialy, but i am going to let me go with a warning today. Still in the challenge

* Day 53
  > Today was tiring. Most of the day, almost all of it was spent learning ML and its aplications. It was exciting seeing so many things built with it. There are so many libraries out there [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org), [keras](https://keras.io), [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org) that either lets you work out of the box or help make you whole process a lot easier (maybe they both are the same thing, who knows). Learning more tomorrow. EDIT: **14 hrs** straight. Thats what a day of proper sleep gives me the next day.

* Day 54
  > Wasted first half of the day. Spent the second half of second half of the day in figuring out the errors in the Object Detection program that i was building. Now it 12:15 and finally it is done. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/KayDee/Detect-All). I will have to write a pretty detailed README for this to be any useful. Other than that, i have completely forgotten about my DSC and GitHub CE applications. I'll try to spend tomorrow working on those (if i remember). I do suspect a major distraction coming my way (just a feeling).

* Day 55
  > Drafted my Letter of Recommedation for the DSC position and completed Module 2 of GHCE exercise. In the code department, i could only manage to watch a video on JS best practices (don't know how many i've seen now). Tomorrow i have the task of figuring out what to say in my video application for DSC.

* Day 56
  > Worked on the DSC application that i have to submit tomorrow. Other than that, the object detection thing is giving errors again after a slight change (i want it to work offline, not as a notebook). So, it will be a while before i can fix that.

* Day 57
  > Done with the Object detection in every way. It was just a one line thing that was giving the error. Apparently one of the modules had set the OS for the second time. Once you comment the *second time* line, it ran. Other than that, submitted the DSC application. Spent the whole day with just two videos and the *i'm free now* feeling. Just now remembered about the GHCE application. Got to work on it tomorrow.

* Day 58
  > Made a Lissajous table today. Pushed in *Some-Pens*. Other than that, completed the third module of GHCE too. No serious development happening anytime soon.

* Day 59
  > Spent the day making (copying) and fixing a Google Drive API client in Java. There are a lit of errors. Some i fixed. Major ones still remain. Tired today. RIP Stan Lee. I want to say thank you.

* Day 60
  > Made a Drive API client in Java today. Not worth uploading though. My advice, stick to the official documentation, don't go to other links. They have different implementations.

* Day 61
  > Bug fixing in PHP today. Other than that only youtube and a bit of research (youtube) on Data visualisation tools. Small work today, still feeling a bit stressed.

* Day 62
  > Worked with the Drive API program. Somehow it broke again. Other than that, completed a module of GHCE too. Hopefully i remember to do that tomorrow too. Something else planned for tomorrow too.

* Day 63
  > Worked with a lil bit of Java. Other than that youtube video too. So, a regular day, nothing new.

* Day 64
  > Completed one more module of GHCE. Thats it.
